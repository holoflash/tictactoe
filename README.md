This game is a classic game of tic-tac-toe, where two players take turns placing their mark on a 3x3 game board. 

The game has three different AI algorithms for players to choose from via the dropdown menus:

AI 1: The computer places its mark on the first available empty square.
AI 2: The computer places its mark on a random empty square.
AI 3: Using the AI 2 algorithm until I implement the minimax.

Alternatively, players can play local multiplayer by setting both players to use the 'human' algorithm. In this case, both players can take turns clicking on an empty square to place their mark on the game board.

Pressing "New Game" starts the game. After each turn, the game checks for a winner. If there's a winner, the game ends and that player's score is incremented and displayed below the gameboard. The players can then start a new game or play a rematch.
